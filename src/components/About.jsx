          As an entrepreneurially-driven final-year MEng student at Imperial College London, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of developing a large wealth of both leadership and technical experience, as well as a track record of ambitious projects. I pursue mental stimulation through software development, discretionary trading and investing (+600% since Q4 2023), and Chess.
  <br/><br/>
  As President of the 600-large Imperial Blockchain Society, I spearhead extensive industrial partnerships with Tier 1 financial Institutions and engineering companies, organise and run frequent major events and educational programs, lead a dedicated committee, and host educational lectures. 
  <br/><br/>
  I founded ImperialDAO, an organisation of 50 talented Imperial Staff/Students/Alumni now engaging in FinTech product development, venture capital, and market-trading fund management.
  <br/><br/>
  While at university, my work experience at HSBC, an AI Start-Up accelerator, and Napa Society, have afforded me a strong professional network and valuable insights into professional software development, the startup and venture capital ecosystem, and the Web3 industry.
